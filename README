This library is a Haskell wrapper around the C libpcap library.

It provides Haskell bindings for most of the libpcap API as of libpcap
version 0.9.7.  The bindings are divided into a very efficient
low-level wrapper, Network.Pcap.Base, and a higher-level module,
Network.Pcap, that's easier to use.
